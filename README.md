# insects

This is a simulation of the problem described in Chapter 18 of Tracking the Automatic Ant, by David Gale and a variation on that problem.

ants.py simulates the original problem using square tiles, while bees.py uses triangular tiles.

To run the program, open and run insects.py and then select from the menu which mode you want to run it in.

This program uses the Menu class written by Scott Barlow found [Here](http://pygame.org/project-MenuClass-1260-.html) and a text input class found [Here](http://pygame.org/project-EzText-920-.html).
